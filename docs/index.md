# Introduction

## Overview

This site contains notes for the following courses:

* **PROGRAMMING FOR DATA MANAGEMENT & ANALYSIS**, sections:
  * All Python sections (except for "Python packages" and JSON files)
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * SQL
  * PySpark

taught by Gerard Conangla Planes.

The notes cover almost all topics that are needed for the courses (and sometimes a bit more), 
but there might be some gaps and typos. I will include more chapters in the notes as the semester advances.

    It is recommended to complement this notes with information from the rest of the bibliography, 
    the internet and, of course, a lot of **practice** doing exercises.
