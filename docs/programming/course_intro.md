## Course introduction

### Review of the course organisation
- What is the course about:
  - Learning programming with Python
    - Small poll to see who has programmed before
    - Small poll to see what you want to do after 
  - Automating the really boring stuff
  - Manipulation of dataframes (why Excel is ok but this is much better):
    - Examples of Excel being used wrong (ESA, COVID UK)
    - From Excel to Pandas, and if necessary to PySpark
  - Getting familiar with data extraction from SQL databases
- Why with Python (it is the current standard: everyone uses it, it is easy, 
  no compilation, LOTS of examples on the internet)
- Why SQL: same reason (it is much older but it is still the standard + well integrated with Python)

### The practical stuff 
- Evaluation criteria percentage and details on them
    Class Participation 15 %
    Midterm 20 %
    Group Assignment 30 %
    Final Exam 35 %
- Class expected behaviour
- How are classes going to be:
  - Start by noting assistance (you are expected to attend, bla bla bla)
  - Course topics and examples in class with participation, blackboard etc.
  - Final section of programming with assistance from professor
  - Some classes are going to be 100% problem solving

## Introduction

- Review of computer architecture.
- Overview of computer programming
  - What is it? Executing instructions one after the other
    - Shopping list
  - Executing does not require any intelligence (there's a lot of hype with AI,
    but it is nothing else than very sophisticated instructions executors), just
    an understanding of the basic operations (review of basic computer operations)
- Types of programming languages. Many ways of separating them:
  - General programming language: (you can do anything you want, really (C, C++, Python))
  - Domain specific: SQL (retrieve information from a Database)
  - 
  - "Procedural programming languages" (execute this instruction: C, C++, Python (more or less)).
  - "Declarative programming languages" (I want to do this, but you decide how (SQL)).
  - 
  - Compiled vs interpreted languages
  - Strongly typed vs. weakly typed.

- And finally Python!
- Python console, terminal and IDEs.
  - Examples
