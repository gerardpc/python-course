various derived objects (such as arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on 
arrays, including:

* Generic mathematical and logical operations
* Array shape manipulation
* Sorting
* Linear algebra
* Fourier transforms
* Basic statistical operations (including random numbers)

and much more.
