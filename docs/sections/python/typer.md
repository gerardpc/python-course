# Typer

Typer is a library for building command-line interface (CLI) applications in Python. It is built on top of 
[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) (another popular CLI library) and makes it very easy 
to build complex CLI applications by providing a clean interface for defining commands and arguments.

## Installation

Typer can be installed with `pip`:

```

## Usage

It is recommended to use Typer in a Pythonh project with a clean directory structure. This makes it easier to
organize the code and to add new commands and arguments.
